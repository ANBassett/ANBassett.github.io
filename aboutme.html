<h1> Hello, I'm Amber. </h1>

<p> I am a research scientist and plant breeder working to understand the genetic control of quality traits in plants. Specifically, my research has focused on the genetics underlying dry bean quality traits using quantitative genetics, sensory evaluation, and scanning electron microscopy approaches. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to pursue plant breeding and genetics in an industry setting to develop new plant varieties with grower and consumer appeal. </p>

<p> I received my PhD in Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology from Michigan State University and my B.S. in Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Now, I am working with Dr. Karen Cichy of the USDA-ARS to phenotype sensory traits in beans and develop a breeding program for beans with superior flavor, texture, and flour quality. </p>

<p> In my personal life, I spend a lot of time thinking about, cooking, or eating food, and I endeavor to spend more time running, biking, or inline skating to strike a balance. I also enjoy gardening, playing games, and pursuing creative projects.
