<h1> Hello, I'm Amber. </h1>

<p> I am a research scientist at Amycel Spawn Mate/Monterey Mushrooms working to develop high quality button mushroom varieties via robust data analysis pipelines and phenotyping methods. My expertise includes data analysis (R, SAS, Python, Unix), experimental design, statistical genetics, and project management. I enjoy creative problem-solving, learning new skills, and community building, and I am achievement-oriented and resourceful, with experience in both team-based and independent projects in public and private research programs. </p>

<p> I received my PhD in Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology from Michigan State University. My research focused on statistical genetics approaches to understand genetic control of quality traits in dry beans. I have a B.S. in Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. </p>

<p> In my personal life, I spend a lot of time thinking about, cooking, or eating food, and I endeavor to spend more time running, biking, or inline skating to strike a balance. I also enjoy painting, playing games, and pursuing creative projects.
