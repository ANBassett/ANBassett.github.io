<h1> Cooking Time </h1>


<img src="/img/CT.png" style="float:left;width:160px;height:170px;" alt="Graphic representing cooking time of dry beans">

<p><b> Overview </b> <br>
Dry beans are a healthful, globally available staple food that are gaining popularity as a plant-based protein. However, their long cooking times deter some consumers from choosing to purchase and eat beans. In addition, long cooking times could be increasing energy costs for the canning industry.</p>

<p><b> Genetic Mapping </b><br>

Cooking time varies by genotype, or the genetic makeup of a bean, but currently, there is a lack of genetic resources available to breeders who wish to develop varieties with fast cooking time. I am interested in using genome-wide association and QTL mapping to identify genomic loci relevant for cooking time. These loci can then be used to develop genetic markers for marker-assisted selection of fast cooking time. </p>

<p> A recent genome-wide association <u><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-020-03745-3">study</a></u> I published in Theoretical and Applied Genetics with Dr. Kelvin Kamfwa, Daniel Ambachew, and Dr. Karen Cichy adds to the current understanding of the genetics of cooking time, validating some previously identified QTL and identifying new loci related to cooking time. A forthcoming QTL mapping study supports these findings. </p>

<p><b> Seed Traits </b><br>

Genotype has an impact on cooking time. We also know that seed traits vary by genotype, and seed coat and cotyledon characteristics might play a role in cooking time. The seed coat surrounding a bean serves as a barrier to water uptake, which is something that occurs during both soaking and cooking. It has previously been shown that genotypes with thicker seed coats have reduced water uptake, so I am interested in how seed coat thickness affects cooking time as a result. During cooking, cell walls in the cotyledon partially solubilize, which allows cells to separate and beans to soften. I am interested in whether cell wall thickness or differences in cell wall solubility affects cooking time. </p>

<p>A <u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109886">study</a></u> I published in Food Research International with Dr. Sharon Hooper and Dr. Karen Cichy addresses these questions. We found that physical and compositional traits of the seed coat and cell wall impact cooking time of beans differently depending whether they are soaked or unsoaked.</p>

<p><b> Canning Quality </b><br>
Canning quality refers to how well a genotype cans in terms of its appearance and texture. Breeders evaluate canning quality when developing new varieties by canning genotypes and assessing their appearance and texture. The canning process involves pressure cooking beans at high temperatures. I am interested in whether our canning process leads to overcooked beans for genotypes with fast cooking times. Overcooked beans exhibit excess splits and mushy texture, which are also associated with poor canning quality. </p>

<p>A <u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.10444">study</a></u> I published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture with Dr. Kirk Dolan and Dr. Karen Cichy found that canning quality of fast cooking beans benefits from shorter retort processing times.</p>

<h1> Flavor and Texture </h1>

<img src="/img/FT.png" style="float:left;width:295px;height:201px;" alt="Graphic representing flavor and texture of dry beans">

<p><b> Overview </b> <br>
Flavor and texture drive consumer purchasing decisions, and these factors are considered by food product developers. However, flavor and texture are not often considered in dry bean breeding. Focusing on flavor and texture in new varieties could encourage consumers to include beans in their diet more frequently and contribute to the success of new food products using beans as ingredients.

<p><b> Sensory Evaluation </b> <br>

Sensory evaluation of genotypes in a breeding program can be very time consuming and expensive, particularly for crops like dry beans that have to be cooked to be edible. For genetic studies, many genotypes must be evaluated quickly to prevent changes in quality due to seed age. I am interested in developing high throughput sensory evaluation methods for dry beans using both trained panelists and instrumental measurements so that breeders and researchers can more easily account for these traits in their programs. </p>

<p><b> Genetic Mapping </b> <br>
Dry bean breeders do not typically evaluate flavor and texture in part because they are difficult and expensive to evaluate. Breeders could greatly benefit from genetic markers that allow them to account for flavor and texture without having to evaluate all of their breeding lines. I am interested in using genome-wide association analyses and QTL mapping to identify genomic loci relevant for flavor and texture. These loci can then be used to develop genetic markers for marker-assisted selection of flavor and texture traits.</p>

<p>A recent genome-wide association <u><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-020-03745-3">study</a></u> I published (mentioned above) provides a foundation for marker development for sensory attribute intensity of total, beany, vegetative, earthy, starchy, sweet, and bitter flavor traits and seed coat and cotyledon texture traits. A forthcoming QTL mapping study supports these findings. </p>

<p><b> Bean Flour </b> <br>
As dry beans are increasingly recognized for their protein content and suitability in plant-based diets, food product developers are looking to use beans are ingredients. One way to incorporate beans in a product is as a flour, but there are many pretreatments, milling methods, and genotypes available that impact flour quality. I am interested in understanding the genetics of flour quality in dry beans and which flavors and associated volatiles contribute or detract from flour quality
